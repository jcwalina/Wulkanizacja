# Wulkanizacja - A Responsive Website for a Polish Tire Service Company

**Wulkanizacja** is a static, fully responsive website that I personally designed and developed using React. Built for a real Polish tire service company, the site provides clients with essential information about the company's services and offerings in a clean and user-friendly manner. The project showcases my front-end development and web design skills, emphasizing responsive design and performance.
